<h1>Theft Report Management System Software Project</h1>
<br>
<h3>**This project is only supported in Visual Studio 2015 version</h3>
<br>
<b> SCOPE OF THE PROJECT </b>
<br>
 The scope of the project includes the design and implementation of a Theft Report 
Management System that will facilitate the management of thefts records in a digital platform. 
The system will handle various operations such as managing the details of thefts, managing 
law and order details, managing court details related to various cases, and generating theft 
reports. The project involves designing a user-friendly interface and implementing the backend 
using VB.NET and MySQL Server. The system will manage various types of data including 
theft details, law and order details, court details, and theft reports. The project aims to automate 
the manual processes involved in managing theft files, thereby reducing paperwork and the 
possibility of errors. Ensuring the security and privacy of the data in the system is a crucial part 
of the project scope. The system will include a help module to provide support to the users.

<b> PROBLEM DEFINITION </b> 
<br>
The current manual system of managing theft files is inefficient and time-consuming. 
Manual data entry and management are prone to errors which can lead to misinformation 
and miscommunication. The existing system does not provide quick and easy access to 
information, which can hinder decision-making processes. The manual system lacks robust 
security measures, putting sensitive data at risk. The absence of automation in the current 
system leads to increased paperwork and decreased productivity.
